# Lab 8 - Starter
Leo Hu, Alex Yoza
1. I would manually run them locally before pushing code. This will help with the debugging process as well as testing code in increments. For this lab, each part was synchronous and relied on the previous test to be accurate. If I chose number 3, then It would be a lot more difficult to pinpoint where the bugs are. If I chose number 1, I would be pushing code that doesn't work and then finding out about possible errors after. If I was working on a group project, this would allow for a lot of errors being pushed into the main code which would result in errors for everyone else. 
2. No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. End to end tests are designed to simulate the user and their interactions as well as test the entire code from start to finish. This include all the components as for this lab we had many different components to consider. To test for output, I typically just used console.log to print out variables which helped me see where I was going wrong.
